                        <br>
                        <p>Most people struggle to find a single persona, Mr.Tarun Chauhan has found himself not one but multiple personas as a Crickter, marketing professional and a farmer! His career as a cricketer started at the young age of 19. When most people are wandering the halls of college, he was interacting with the who’s who of the cricket world. Mr. Chauhan did not let the glorious cricketing world confine him; he went on to serve as the managing partner in one of the world’s biggest advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson. Tarun soon found himself at the pinnacle of success, with innumerable brands chasing after him to breathe life into their ad campaigns. Highlights from his repertoire include the popular “What an Idea Sir Ji” brand campaign for Idea and the inspirational “Jaago Re” campaign for Tata Tea. In spite of all of the work that surrounds him, he has managed to find time to pursue his hobbies. A talented farmer, he grows his own food, runs a dairy farm, and rears horses. Only a selected few are able to keep their spirits high at all times and follow their hearts and Tarun is certainly one of them.</p>

The accomplished architect does not allow the pressure and work-load of life to hinder his pursuit of his passions - whether it is composing soothing melodies on a piano or capturing awe-inspiring tigers on a camera. Having ventured into various creative avenues, Nayan knows and understands the importance of discovering the fire that makes you move. This makes him the perfect addition to our roster of speakers at TEDxYouth@JPIS.</p>

His first invention was the Breathing Sensor Apparatus, a device through which disabled people can perform various tasks through simple breathing actions. It garnered Susant numerous plaudits and panegyrics in addition to awards on a national and international level. Susant thus epitomises the fact that technology can indeed better lives and spark change and development.

Wise beyond his years, Mitre is a vibrant student who invariably brings new perspectives to discussions and fills the room with his contagious energy. Having survived a “tornado” most people shudder to even think of, he knows the hardships of life even at a very young age but never lets them abate his optimism. His proficiency with equations that seem alien to most people makes him a favourite of his science and math teachers (and the students too who swarm him during exam times). Watch out for this youngster who brings new meaning to the idiom “More than meets the eye.”</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>From humble beginnings in a household that depended on agriculture for sustenance, Baichung Bhutia has sprouted into a truly global personality. Right from the start, Baichung was a fervent sportsman, trying his hand at countless sports such as badminton and track athletics, along with football of course. His financial shortcomings never hindered his pursuit of glory, with his varsity talent bagging him myriads of scholarships that supported his climb to the international pedestal of sports. At his position as a striker, Baichung has played for the Indian National Team, East Bengal Team, Mohun Bagan Team and bagged prestigious awards and titles such as Padmashree Award, Arjuna Award, Banga Bhushan Award, Nehru cup, and the ASEAN cup. Off the field, Baichang has showcased his eclectic personality on the Indian television dance show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, which he won in 2009. Baichung will be retiring in 2015 from International Football and aims to expand the football training facilities in the Indian subcontinent through his partnership with Carlos Queiroz and Nike in the form of “Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools”</p>

                        <p>Who better to represent the strong and independent women of the nation than Wing Commander Pooja Thakur, the first Indian woman officer to lead the Guard of Honour for a major visiting dignitary at the presidential palace? The fact that the “major visiting dignitary” in this case was the President of the United States, Barack Obama, is just the cherry on the top. An administrative officer with nearly 14 years of experience in the Indian Air Force, Wg Cdr Thakur garnered innumerable plaudits and the respect of the entire nation after she saluted the POTUS with exemplary confidence. She was also actively involved with the development of “Guardians of the Sky,” a mobile gaming app launched by DISHA, the publicity division for officers’ induction of the IAF. The app successfully captured the eye of the Indian youth, immersing bright youngsters into combat-replicating scenarios through flying missions. Wing Commander Thakur epitomises the notion that women are equal to men in all aspects and inspires young girls throughout the country to stand tall and confident</p>
