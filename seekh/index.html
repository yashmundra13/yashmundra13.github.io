								<h2>About us</h2>

								<h2>Vatsalya</h2>
								<p>Seekh visits a school for orphans named “Vatsalya”, which provides parental care and motherly affection to the destitute children; changing their vagabond life to normal life, in the first week of January. Kids are taught English and Math, through various interactive sessions. This fun filled, yet an informative workshop turns out to be fruitful for the children and the volunteers as well. We believe, at the end of the day, it's not the materialistic pleasure that will bring them satisfaction, but their cognition.</p>
